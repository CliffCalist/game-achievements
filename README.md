# Game Achievements

Game Achievements is a flexible and extensible achievement system for Unity. It separates core logic, configuration, and runtime handlers, allowing for clean and modular achievement implementation in any game.

## Features

### General
- All components — achievements, rewards, and groups — are fully composable and work independently
- All configurations (for achievements, rewards, and groups) are defined via ScriptableObjects
- Full snapshot system to save and restore runtime state, including individual achievements and groups

### Achievements
- Handlers are MonoBehaviours, allowing both inspector-based setup and full dependency injection
- One handler can manage multiple achievements of the same type
- No manual mapping: handlers and rewards are resolved automatically based on config type

### Groups
- Achievement groups support custom logic and grouping behavior
- Groups can be static or time-based with automatic refresh
- Timed groups can optionally preserve completed (but unclaimed) achievements during refresh

```

# Quick Start

## Step 1 — Create a reward dispenser

Each reward consists of two parts:

- `RewardConfig`: a ScriptableObject that holds configuration data
- `IRewardDispencer`: interface that defines how the reward is actually granted

The base `RewardConfig` already includes `Amount`. Is a numeric value representing how much reward to give.
These field don’t need to be duplicated in your subclass — just inherit and add what’s specific to your reward type.

For example, a reward that grants a currency might look like this:

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Achievements/Rewards/Currency")]
public class CurrencyRewardConfig : RewardConfig
{
    [SerializeField] private string _currencyId;
    public string CurrencyId => _currencyId;
}
```

Then implement the actual reward logic by creating a class that implements `IRewardDispencer`. The config arrives as the base `RewardConfig`, so cast it to your type:

```csharp
public class CurrencyRewardDispencer : IRewardDispencer
{
    public Type TargetConfigType {get; } = typeof(CurrencyRewardConfig);

    public void DispenseReward(RewardConfig rewardConfig)
    {
        if (rewardConfig is not CurrencyRewardConfig config)
            throw new InvalidCastException($"Expected {nameof(CurrencyRewardConfig)}, got {rewardConfig.GetType().Name}");

        PlayerWallet.Add(config.CurrencyId, config.Amount);
    }
}
```

## Step 2 — Create an achievement

Each achievement is defined by two parts:

- `AchievementConfig`: a ScriptableObject that holds metadata and conditions
- `AchievementHandler`: a component that listens for game events and forwards progress to the correct achievements

The base `AchievementConfig` includes:

- `Id` — identification
- `TargetProgress` — required value for completion
- `Reward` — the reward to be granted

To define your own achievement, subclass `AchievementConfig` with additional parameters:

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Achievements/Configs/Kill Enemies")]
public class KillEnemiesAchievementConfig : AchievementConfig
{
    [SerializeField] private string _enemyType;
    public string EnemyType => _enemyType;
}
```

Then, create a handler that tracks related gameplay events and reports progress. Handlers inherit from `AchievementHandler`, which provides:

- A list of tracked achievements
- Validation logic
- Utility methods for applying progress

Example handler:

```csharp
public class KillEnemiesAchievementHandler : AchievementHandler
{
    public void OnEnemyKilled(string killedType)
    {
        foreach (var achievement in _achievements)
        {
            if (achievement is KillEnemiesAchievement kill && kill.EnemyType == killedType)
                kill.AddProgress(1);
        }
    }
}
```

The framework does not require handlers to be initialized in any specific way. However, if a handler needs to subscribe to events, retrieve dependencies, or perform other setup logic, the developer is responsible for implementing that according to their project requirements.

## Step 3 — Configure achievement groups

The framework provides built-in support for static and time-based achievement groups.

- **Simple Group**: Displays all assigned achievements.
- **Timed Group**: Periodically refreshes a limited set of visible achievements.

Both group types require only a ScriptableObject config to set up.

Example: Create a timed group config via the Unity editor menu:

```
Assets → Create → Achievements → Simple/Timed Group
```

All group configs inherit from the base `AchievementGroupConfig`, which includes:

- `Id`: a unique identifier for the group
- `Achievements`: a list of achievement configs included in the group

The default `SimpleAchievementGroup` adds no extra logic — it simply groups achievements, making it suitable for representing categories like "Daily", "Exploration", or "Challenges".

Custom groups can be implemented by inheriting from `AchievementGroup<TConfig>` and creating your own config type.

## Step 4 — Create and initialize the AchievementsService

```csharp
public class MyAchievementSystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private List<AchievementHandler> _handlers;

    [SerializeField] private List<IAchievementRewardDispencer> _rewardDispencers;
    [SerializeField] private List<AchievementConfig> _achievementConfigs;
    [SerializeField] private SimpleAchievementGroup _simpleGroupConfig;

    private AchievementsService _service;

    private void Start()
    {
        // Create achievement factory and service, then register handlers and achievements
        var factory = new AchievementFactory(_rewardDispencers);
        _service = new AchievementsService(factory);
        _service.AddManyHandlers(_handlers);
        _service.AddManyAchievementsByConfig(_achievementConfigs);

        // Create and add groups
        // If the factory instance is not accessible, you can use service.AchievementFactory
        var simpleGroup = new SimpleAchievementGroup(_simpleGroupConfig, factory);
        _service.AddGroup(simpleGroup);

        // Initialize the service — this also initializes all groups (starts timers, etc.)
        _service.Init();
    }

    private void OnDestroy()
    {
        _service.Dispose();
    }
}
```


# Advanced Topics

## Saving and Restoring State

The framework interacts with achievement and group state through interfaces. This allows you to implement your own snapshot classes tailored to your save system.

Both `Achievement` and `AchievementGroup` support saving and restoring via:

```csharp
var snapshot = new MySnapshotImplementation();
target.CaptureStateTo(snapshot); // Save current state into snapshot

// ... Later:
target.RestoreState(snapshot);  // Restore state from snapshot
```

### Achievement Snapshot

Implement `IAchievementSnapshot` to represent the state of a single achievement:

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class MyAchievementSnapshot : IAchievementSnapshot
{
    [SerializeField] private string _id;
    [SerializeField] private int _progress;
    [SerializeField] private bool _isRewardDispenced;



    public string Id
    {
        get => _id;
        set => _id = value;
    }

    public int Progress
    {
        get => _progress;
        set => _progress = value;
    }

    public bool IsRewardDispensed
    {
        get => _isRewardDispenced;
        set => _isRewardDispenced = value;
    }
}
```

### Group Snapshot

Implement `IAchievementGroupSnapshot` to represent a group of achievements:

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class MyAchievementGroupSnapshot : IAchievementGroupSnapshot
{
    [SerializeField] private string _id;
    [SerializeField] private List<MyAchievementSnapshot> _achievements = new();



    public string Id
    {
        get => _id;
        set => _id = value;
    }
    
    public IEnumerable<IAchievementSnapshot> Achievements => _achievements.Cast<IAchievementSnapshot>();



    public IAchievementSnapshot CreateAchievement()
    {
        return new MyAchievementSnapshot();
    }

    public void AddAchievement(IAchievementSnapshot snapshot)
    {
        _achievements.Add(snapshot);
    }
}
```

These snapshot classes are fully serializable and can be saved using your preferred system (e.g. JSON, binary, PlayerPrefs, cloud, etc.).

### Achievements Service Snapshot

The `AchievementsService` also supports saving and restoring its full internal state, including both standalone achievements and registered groups.

Keep in mind the following important constraint:

> Before calling `RestoreState()`, you must ensure that all achievement configs and groups have already been added to the service. If a snapshot refers to an unknown achievement or group ID, it will be ignored and a warning will be logged to the console.

To implement a snapshot class for the service, implement the `IAchievementsServiceSnapshot` interface:

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class MyAchievementsServiceSnapshot : IAchievementsServiceSnapshot
{
    [SerializeField] private List<MyAchievementSnapshot> _achievements = new();
    [SerializeField] private List<MyAchievementGroupSnapshot> _groups = new();



    public IEnumerable<IAchievementSnapshot> Achievements => _achievements;
    public IEnumerable<IAchievementGroupSnapshot> Groups => _groups;



    public IAchievementSnapshot CreateAchievement()
    {
        return new MyAchievementSnapshot();
    }

    public IAchievementGroupSnapshot CreateGroup()
    {
        return new MyAchievementGroupSnapshot();
    }



    public void AddAchievement(IAchievementSnapshot snapshot)
    {
        _achievements.Add((MyAchievementSnapshot)snapshot);
    }

    public void AddGroup(IAchievementGroupSnapshot snapshot)
    {
        _groups.Add((MyAchievementGroupSnapshot)snapshot);
    }
}
```

This implementation is serializable and can be persisted using any storage system (e.g. JSON, binary files, PlayerPrefs, cloud saves, etc.).

## TimedAchievementGroup

The `TimedAchievementGroup` is a built-in achievement group that automatically refreshes its list of active achievements based on time intervals.

This group relies on a dedicated configuration asset: `TimedAchievementGroupConfig`, which allows you to specify the following parameters:

1. `int _activeCount` — the maximum number of active achievements at any time
2. `int _refreshTimeRate` — the refresh rate in seconds (how often the active achievements are rotated)
3. `bool _saveUnreceivedAchievements` — if true, completed but unclaimed achievements are preserved between refreshes

Creating an instance of `TimedAchievementGroup` is identical to creating a simple group — just pass in the config and achievement factory.

> **Important:** This group uses the tickable mechanism.  
> Before adding a timed group to the `AchievementsService`, make sure to set the tickable registrar via `SetTickableRegistrar(...)`.

For more details on ticking logic, see the section: **Custom Achievement Groups → Tickable Groups**.

## Custom Achievement Groups

### Config

To define a custom group, you can either reuse the default `AchievementGroupConfig` or subclass it to extend functionality.

If the default config suits your needs, use it directly. Otherwise, create your own config type:

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Achievements/Configs/My Custom Group")]
public class MyCustomAchievementGroupConfig : AchievementGroupConfig
{
    [SerializeField] private int _someExtraParameter;
    public int SomeExtraParameter => _someExtraParameter;
}
```

### Members of AchievementGroup<TConfig>

To define a custom achievement group, inherit from `AchievementGroup<TConfig>`. You get access to the following fields and properties:

- `_config` — the group configuration
- `_achievementFactory` — the factory used to create achievements
- `_achievements` — the list of active achievements
- `IsInited` — whether the group has been initialized

You can override these virtual methods:

- `void RestoreState(IAchievementGroupSnapshot snapshot)`
- `IAchievementGroupSnapshot CaptureStateTo(IAchievementGroupSnapshot snapshot)`
- `void Init()`

> **Important:** The base `Init()` implementation creates achievements based on the configs if they are not already in `_achievements`.  
> If this behavior is not desired, you can skip calling `base.Init()` and implement your own setup.

### IDisposable

If your custom group subscribes to events or holds unmanaged resources, you can implement `IDisposable`.  
The `AchievementsService` automatically checks for this interface and calls `Dispose()` when appropriate, allowing for clean resource management.

### Tickable Groups

Some achievement groups require regular updates — for example, to track time-limited logic. To support this, the framework provides the `ITickableAchievementGroup` interface.

Any custom group can implement this interface to receive periodic tick updates.

However, the system does not provide a default ticker. Instead, the ticking logic is delegated to the developer. This provides full flexibility for how and where ticking is implemented (e.g. MonoBehaviour, ECS, custom timer services).

To support ticking:

1. Implement the `ITickableAchievementGroup` interface in your group.
2. Provide a class that implements `ITickableAchievementGroupRegistrar`.
3. When the group is added to the `AchievementsService`, the service will automatically register it with the registrar.
4. If no registrar is set in the service when a tickable group is added, an exception will be thrown.

Example interface signatures:

```csharp
public interface ITickableAchievementGroup
{
    void Tick(float deltaTime);
}

public interface ITickableAchievementGroupRegistrar
{
    void Register(ITickableAchievementGroup group);
    void Unregister(ITickableAchievementGroup group);
}
```

To set the registrar on the service:

```csharp
_service.SetTickableRegistrar(myRegistrarInstance);
```

The group will automatically unregister itself when disposed.

### Changing Active Achievements

If a group updates its list of active achievements over time, it must notify the service about the change.  
To do this, call:

```csharp
void RaiseActiveAchievementsChanged(IEnumerable<Achievement> old, IEnumerable<Achievement> current)
```

This informs the `AchievementsService` that the active achievements have changed.  
The service will automatically remove the old achievements from all handlers and distribute the new ones.

### Example

```csharp
public class MyCustomGroup : AchievementGroup<MyCustomAchievementGroupConfig>, IDisposable, ITickableAchievementGroup
{
    public MyCustomGroup(MyCustomAchievementGroupConfig config, IAchievementFactory factory) 
        : base(config, factory)
    {}

    public override void Init()
    {
        if (IsInited)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("This group has already been initialized.");

        // Custom logic before or after base.Init()
    
        base.Init(); // Remove or use this line depending on your needs

        IsInited = true;
    }

    public override void RestoreState(IAchievementGroupSnapshot snapshot)
    {
        base.RestoreState(snapshot);
        // Custom logic restoring state
    }

    public override IAchievementGroupSnapshot CaptureStateTo(IAchievementGroupSnapshot snapshot)
    {
        // Custom logic capturing state
        return base.CaptureStateTo(snapshot);
    }

    public void Tick(float deltaTime)
    {
        // Ticking logic for the group
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        // Unsubscribe from events or cleanup here if needed
    }
}
```

## UI Integration

While it might be tempting to add UI-specific fields like icons, titles, or descriptions directly to the achievement and group configs, doing so would violate the Single Responsibility Principle and reduce flexibility.

Instead, we recommend using a dedicated UI config layer — for example, by integrating the [ViewConfigurations](https://github.com/CliffCalist/view-configurations) framework. It allows you to define separate ScriptableObject-based configurations specifically for the UI representation of your data.

This approach offers multiple benefits:

- Clear separation of concerns between gameplay logic and UI
- Easier reuse and testing of configs
- More scalable and flexible customization options (e.g., per-locale labels, conditional formatting, etc.)

Refer to the [ViewConfigurations](https://github.com/CliffCalist/view-configurations) README for more information on how to structure and link UI configs to achievements or groups.
